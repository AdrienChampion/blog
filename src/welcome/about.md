# About Me

Hi. I'm [Adrien Champion]. I have a PhD in software safety and worked on critical embedded systems
(systems controlling planes, nuclear plants, cars, *etc.*) during both my PhD and my first postdoc
at the [University of Iowa] with [Cesare Tinelli], where I worked on the [Kind 2] model checker. I
did my second postdoc at the [University of Tokyo] with [Naoki Kobayashi]. I worked on higher-order
model-checking: I developed the [hoice] Horn Clause solver which proved quite efficient for
problems stemming from higher-order program verification.

I now work at [OCamlPro]. Currently, most of my work there targets [tezos] smart contracts,
[Michelson] which is tezos' language for smart contracts, and [Liquidity], an OCaml-like
(relatively) high-level language which (de)compiles to/from michelson.

I am interested in software safety and strongly-typed high-level languages such as [Rust] and
[OCaml]. I still occasionally work on (critical) embedded system verification.
